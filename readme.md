I made this based off of react-native-responsive-dimensions which uses the device size from react's native modules to allow you to scale X and Y in your app based on the device size. This worked great, but when I started working on the Tablet version and everything was a different aspect ratio I realized I needed to be able to set different properties for tablet and phone.  I used a ternary and used the NativeModules to determine whether the user was on tablet or not.  

As soon as I started working on the Android version I realized I would need specific settings for that too.  The ternary became nested and intense and I wanted to abstract it away.  Hence this component.  I hope it helps you.  I plan to keep working on it to make cross platform and device styling a lot easier.

## Install
```bash
$ npm install react-native-cross-responsive-dimensions --save
```

## Usage
1. Add an import to the top of your file with the methods you need.
    ```js
    import {
        responsiveHeight,
        responsiveWidth,
        responsiveFontSize,
        crossResponsiveHeight,
        crossResponsiveWidth,
        crossResponsiveFontSize,
        crossPlatformOS,
        crossPlatformDevice } from "react-native-cross-platform-responsive-dimensions";
    ```
2. Use the cross platform methods in your jss stylesheets. The function takes allows you to use responsive dimensions, setting different values with arguments that match the device: (IOS phone, IOS tablet, AndroidPhone, AndroidTablet). 

This will also help lock the values for each device and OS to avoid wack-a-mole fix-breaking something on a different device than you're testing on.
    ```
    container: {
        backgroundColor: "white",
        height: crossResponsiveHeight(43, 43, 43, 43),
        marginLeft: crossResponsiveWidth(10, 10, 10, 10),
        marginRight: crossResponsiveWidth(10, 10, 10, 10),
        top: crossResponsiveHeight(-14, -14, -14, -14),
        width: crossResponsiveWidth(80, 80, 80, 80)
    },
    ballConnected: {
        color: "green",
        fontFamily: crossPlatformOS("Neuropolitical", "neuropolitical_regular"),
        fontSize: crossResponsiveFontSize(4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5),
        marginTop: crossResponsiveHeight(-30, -30, -20, -30),
        textAlign: "center",
        top: crossResponsiveHeight(10, 10, 10, 10)
    },
    ```
3. Use crossPlatformDevice(iosPhone, iosTablet, androidPhone, androidTablet) for the same cross platform ease, but without the responsive scaling.
    ```
    <Image
        style={crossPlatformDevice(
            styles.giantBallImage,
            styles.giantBallImageTablet,
            styles.giantBallImage,
            styles.giantBallImageTablet
        )}
        source={require("../../../img/home_ball.png")}
    />
    ```
4. Use crossPlatformOS(ios, android) when you don't need to specify individual values for all devices, but only need to specify either android or ios. Similar to crossPlatform device this doesn't produce an integer value. This is useful for fonts because each OS requires that the font be called differently.
    ```
    crossPlatformOS("Neuropolitical", "neuropolitical_regular")
    ```
